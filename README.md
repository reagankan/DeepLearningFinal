The original repository is from Lucas Hu (https://github.com/lucashu1/link-prediction). 
The code was updated for Python 3.7, and our dataset. I used the dataset from https://github.com/anchit/224w-project to start.
To generate new datasets, use the master branch and use the parse_yt_file.py file provided. The parse_yt_file creates an edgelist for the network.

Note: when using machines with larger memory spaces, the entire network can be used. I am currently using 1/50 of the network due to limitations.
